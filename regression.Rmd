```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Linear models are often specified with Wilkinson-Rogers
notation. You can find an online reference  [here](http://jerous.org/att/2016/05/11/wilkinson-rogers/wilkinson2formula.html). Let's try to predict a car's mpg using the mtcars dataset.

```{r}
m1 <- lm(mpg ~ hp, data=mtcars)
summary(m1)
m2 <- lm(mpg ~ hp + wt, data=mtcars)
anova(m2,m1)
```

Create comparison models that add predictors 1-by-1 until
you include all the columns in the mtcars data frame.
Add 2 way interactions. Use anova to compare models.

## Retrospective

What does knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) do? What happens
when echo is set to FALSE?
