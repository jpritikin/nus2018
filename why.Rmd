## Reproducible results

You address an **important** topic in your publish manuscript.

Suppose somebody wants to **verify** the analysis.

How can you make this **easy**?

## Two components

Your manuscript depends on

- Statistical analysis software (SPSS, R, etc)
- Data and specifically how you analyzed these data

## Two components

- **Statistical analysis software (SPSS, R, etc)**
- Data and specifically how you analyzed these data

## Statistical analysis sofware

Suppose you use SPSS (a proprietary software)

>- Software costs money
>- In 10 years, the old version you used may not be available
>- Worse, SPSS could be discontinued by the publisher

## Open source software

In contrast R,

>- Is free
>- Old versions are preserved
>- Will be available indefinitely

## Cut & paste

Results can be copied from a statistical report and paste into
the manuscript copy.

>- Tedious
>- Error prone
>- Process is not documented and hard to verify

## Reproducible analyses

Final text is produced automatically with
statistical results directly integrated into
the text.

Tables and graphs are similarly automatically
produced.

>- Tedious to set up but
>- Process is documented
>- Analyses can be easily verified by peers

## How to learn?

You're convinced. Now what?

>- Learn by doing
>- Grasp the fundamentals for long-term benefits
>- Ask for help
>- Seek out online resources
>- Donâ€™t just read sample code. Tinker with it!
>- Expect to fail repeatedly
>- Be patient with your progress
