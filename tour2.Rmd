# Introduction

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

You can also perform calcuations that are inserted directly into the
text. For example, 524 + 302 = `r 524 + 302`. This type of document is
comfortable for writing a Results section. The advantage is that if
any error is corrected in collected data (perhaps a coding error)
then the downstream analyses can be automatically updated!

This is also a good format in which to plan specific analyses
prior to data collection for a pre-registered study.

# Iris

```{r}
options(digits=2, scipen=1)
data(iris)
```

The correlation between sepal length and width
is `r cor(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width)`.

The correlation between sepal and petal length
is INSERT HERE.

Let us examine the distribution of petal length.

```{r}
hist(iris$Petal.Length)
```

It is also fascinating to examine the distribution of sepal length.

```{r}
# INSERT CODE HERE
```

The pairs plot shows all bivariate scatterplots.

```{r}
pairs(iris[,-5])
```

Let us look at the covariance matrix of the continuous
variables.

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
cov(iris[,-5]) %>% kable()
```

For ordinal data, ample tools are available such as
Cronbach's alpha and Guttman's Lambda 6.

```{r}
library(psych)
r4 <- sim.congeneric()
alpha(r4)
```

## Retrospective

Change the original mathematical expression 524 + 302 to
something else? What happens?

What do the parameters in the 'options' line do?

Knit to HTML, PDF, and Word. Which format is most useful
for your manuscripts?
